Crohn's disease is an autoinflamatory disease affecting the digestive tract, influences by genetic and enironmental factors. While most studies on Crohn's disease focus on epithelial cels in ileal and colonic tissue, the contributions of circulating immune cels remain less understood. To address this, we conducted a high-resolution single cell multiomic analysis (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data from the same cells) of immune cells from African Americans with Crohn's disease, accounting for donor-specific heterogeneity in an unsupervised manner. By combining single-cell transcriptomics and epigenetic data, we identify distinct biological signtures and varying immune dysfunction severity, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of Crohn's disease. Joint analysis of transcriptomic and epigenetic data revealed differential gene regulatory mechanisms, some Crohn's disease specific, some specific to general heterogeneous profiles of circulating immune cells among individuals. Genotype data indicates potential disruptions in gene regulatory processes, emphasizing the importance of understanding disease heterogeneity through comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomix profiling (particularly in minority populations). Our findings emphasize the need for personalized medicine approaches in Crohn's disease management.
